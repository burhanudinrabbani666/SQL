## Working With Fixed Point & Floating Point Numbers

### Floating point

Floating point numbers are another way to express decimal numbers, but without exact, consistent precision. Instead, floating point types only have a concept of a maximum precision which is often related to the architecture and platform of the hardware.

For example, to limit a floating point column to 8 digits of precision, you can type:

```sql
FLOAT(8)
```

Because of these design choices, floating point numbers can work with numbers with large number of decimals efficiently, but not always exactly. The internal representation of numbers may cause slight differences between the input and output. This can cause unexpected behavior when comparing values, doing floating point math, or performing operations that require exact values.
