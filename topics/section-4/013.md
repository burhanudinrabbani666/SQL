## Closer Look at Numeric Value types

### Integer ("Whole") Numbers

```sql
INT, SMALLINT, ...
```

> Example: 3, -10, -1831, 8754467826

- Number without any decimal places
- Inserted numbers with decimal places are rounded
- Great for mathematical calculations
- Great for performance
- Differents types of integers occupy different amount of space

### Excat Decimal Point Numbers

```sql
DECIMAL, NUMERIC
```

> Example: 234.756, -8.6457, -10.87

- Numbers with decimal places and exact precison
- Inerted number are stored exactly(no data loss)
- Great for data that requires exactness (e.g monetary)
- Slow Performance
- Precision can be set when the table is created

### Approximate Decimal Point Number

```sql
FLOAT, REAL, ...
```

> Example: 724.23, -9.676, 81274.1

- Number with decimal places and appromiximate precision
- Stored approximately (data loss is possiable)
- Greta for numeric data where exactness is not required
- Great Performance
- Different types of numbers occupy different amounts of space
